# finance-tracker

## Run locally

Start PostgreSQL, then run the backend in a PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
cd backend/backend
.\start-dev.ps1
```

The first run prompts for the local PostgreSQL password and stores it with Windows
user-bound encryption in the Git-ignored `.local` directory. The script also creates
a random development JWT secret and reuses it across restarts. Existing `DB_PASSWORD`
and `JWT_SECRET` environment variables take precedence.

The backend reads deployment configuration from environment variables:

- `DB_URL` (defaults to the local `finance_tracker_db` database)
- `DB_USERNAME` (defaults to `postgres` for local development)
- `DB_PASSWORD` (required)
- `JWT_SECRET` (required when the development script is not used)
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`)
- `DB_DDL_AUTO`, `JPA_SHOW_SQL`, and `JPA_FORMAT_SQL` (optional)

Use separately managed secrets in production and set `DB_DDL_AUTO=validate` after
introducing database migrations.

In a second terminal, start the frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend/finance-tracker-frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Keep both terminals running: the dashboard needs the
backend on port 8080. If the backend was stopped, start it and click **Retry** on
the dashboard. Sign in again if your previous session has expired.
